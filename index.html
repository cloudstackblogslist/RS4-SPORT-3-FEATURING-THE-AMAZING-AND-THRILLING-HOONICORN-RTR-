                    <p>The full-size Hoonicorn RTR is a totally custom, all-out drift machine that was designed by Formula Drift champion Vaughn Gittin Jr.'s RTR design studio and built by ASD Motorsports over 2 years to exacting specifications. It's fitted with a monstrous 410 cubic inch V8 putting out nearly 850 horsepower at a screaming 9000RPM. The engine is mated to a 6-speed Dakar Rally-spec transmission and 4WD drivetrain, with a completely custom adjustable suspension, and 3-piece fifteen52 wheels wrapped with super-wide 18-inch tires made in a custom compound just for Ken Block himself. You can read about the inspiration and design of the one-of-a-kind Hoonicorn RTR in <a href="http://www.speedhunters.com/2014/12/the-hoonicorn-rtr-build-story/"><u>this Speedhunters special article</u></a> by Vaughn Gittin Jr!</p>

The real 18" x 10.5" wheels are made from machined forged 6061 aluminum centers and forged stepped & polished lips, while the replica is molded in high-impact nylon in a custom gold color.</p></div>
                    <h2>REPLICA HOONICORN TIRES</h2>
                    <p>295/30/18 - magic numbers that give the technical side of Ken Block's full-size hoops that are fitted to all four corners of the Hoonicorn RTR. But numbers can't tell the whole story - especially when these tires are made in a custom compound especially for Ken Block himself! The replica tires look exactly like the real thing: extra-wide, semi-slick and super-cool! The scale tires are molded in a durable, long-wearing rubber compound that gives enough grip for awesome acceleration!</p>

                    <h2>OFFICIAL REPLICA OF THE AMAZING, CUSTOM  <br>HOONICORN RTR</h2>
                    <p>Taking the full-size Hoonicorn RTR with its handmade custom body and making it 1/10th scale was a major challenge for the HPI design team, but after months of hard work with scale drawings and hundreds of pictures of the real car, we're proud to call the 1/10th scale Hoonicorn RTR one of HPI's finest achievements. The replica wheels were even made with the help of the original fifteen52 CAD files to replicate their Ken Block special R43 wheels to complete the Hoonicorn's look, and each wheel is wrapped in a scale replica extra-wide semi-slick rubber tires.</p>
                    <p>Underneath all this detail and awesomeness is the RS4 Sport 3 chassis, the latest scale touring car chassis from HPI Racing! The HPI RS4 Sport 3 chassis features full-time 4WD, a completely sealed and highly efficient shaft drivetrain, coilover shock absorbers plus waterproof electronics. The fully contained drivetrain means there are no exposed gears, belts or drivetrain parts to get stuck with rocks or dirt. The car is completely assembled and fitted with the 1965 Ford Mustang Hoonicorn RTR body and fifteen52 wheels right out of the box, so all you have to do is PLUG IN AND DRIVE!</p>
                    <h2>ONE-PIECE MOLDED CHASSIS</h2>
                    <p>The RS4 Sport 3 main chassis is formed from a single piece of reinforced plastic and features the drivetrain tunnel molded right down the middle, just like a real car. It's a step beyond any plastic tub chassis car available today.</p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 30%;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1939/1899/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-26_at_9.47.25_AM_2048x2048.png?v=1514475596"></div>
                    <h2>LOW PROFILE LAYOUT DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>One of the ways we gave the RS4 Sport 3 the best possible handling was to make sure all the components fit as low as possible in the chassis. This gives the car an amazingly low center of gravity for enhanced cornering capabilities.</p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 250px; width: 30%;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1939/1899/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-28_at_10.40.13_AM_2048x2048.png?v=1514475647"></div>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://www.hpiracing.com/assets/images/kits/114343x/battery_frame_01.jpg"></div>
                    <h2>2S LIPO CAPABLE</h2>
                    <p>The RS4 Sport 3 features a versatile electronic speed controller that can be used with modern lithium-polymer (LiPo) or nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. Please note a LiPo adapter plug is not included, your model shop will be able to provide one.</p>
                    <h2>FITS A WIDE VARIETY OF BATTERIES</h2>
                    <p>The RS4 Sport 3 chassis can fit lithium-polymer and nickel-cadmium packs of various sizes, including the extra-long 7-cell Ni-MH packs. Whatever your power requirements, it can hold it all! A thick hook-and-loop strap holds the pack securely in place, and a simple battery block screws into place to allow you to adjust the weight distribution forward or backward for extra steering or acceleration.</p>
                    <h2>FULL-TIME FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE</h2>
                    <p>The RS4 Sport 3 features full-time four-wheel drive to give you the most control and precision on the road or track. All four wheels are driven by heavy duty gear differentials at the front and rear, just like a real car. The extra traction gives you increased acceleration and cornering control for maximum confidence and fun.</p>
                    <h2>SEALED SHAFT DRIVETRAIN</h2>
                    <p>The drivetrain of all the RS4 Sport 3 models features the motor mounted longitudinally in the molded chassis, next to the long driveshaft that goes down the center of the car. The entire drivetrain, including the central driveshaft and gear diffs, is completely sealed to prevent dirt, rocks and debris from damaging or binding the drivetrain. The driveshaft, diffs and axles spin on ball bearings to maximize drivetrain efficiency.</p>
                    <h2>BOTTOM-ACCESS DRIVESHAFT</h2>
                    <p>The central driveshaft that connects the front and rear differentials is easily accessed from underneath the chassis. This allows the drivetrain to be completely sealed to protect it from rocks and debris no matter where you may want to drive your car. </p>
                    <h3>OPTION: CARBON FIBER DRIVESHAFT COVER </h3>
                    <p>You can easily replace the stock driveshaft cover on the bottom of the chassis with a carbon fiber cover that provides extra stiffness and extra-cool looks.</p>
                    <h2>EASY ACCESS DIFFERENTIALS</h2>
                    <p>Getting to the differentials for quick adjustments is a matter of removing just 4 screws - this allows you to pop out the diff and change the grease, check the gears or just give it a general service.</p>
                    <h2>4-GEAR METAL DIFFS</h2>
                    <p>Bevel gear differentials at each end of the car transfer power from the driveshaft to the dogbones and axles that drive each wheel. The all-metal construction allows the drivetrain to withstand powerful brushless motors for easy upgrading in the future. Rubber-sealed ball bearings support the differentials and each diff can be tuned independently by changing the diff grease.</p>
                    <h3>OPTION: DIFF SPOOL </h3>
                    <p>The optional diff spool removes all diff action for direct traction and braking action from your trigger finger straight to the wheels.</p>
                    <h2>DOUBLE-WISHBONE FULLY ADJUSTABLE SUSPENSION</h2>
                    <p>The suspension of the RS4 Sport 3 uses the race-proven double-wishbone suspension design, similar to a full scale modern race car. You’ll be able to control the anti-squat and anti-dive of the front and rear arms using the standard pivot blocks, and the option parts allow you to adjust the sweep and toe angles. You'll also be able to easily change the roll center front and rear with the racing-style vertical ballstud mounting on both the inner and outer camber link mounts. Multiple shock mounting positions provide a full range of shock suspension angle adjustment to suit different road conditions.</p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://www.hpiracing.com/assets/images/kits/114343x/shock_compression_frame_1.jpg"></div>
                    <h2>MULTIPLE SHOCK POSITIONS</h2>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 90px; width: 30%;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1939/1899/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-28_at_10.43.05_AM_2048x2048.png?v=1514475817"></div>
                    <h3>OPTION: CARBON FIBER SHOCK TOWERS</h3>
                    <div style="display: contents; justify-content: left;"><img style="height: 150px; width: 25%; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 50px;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1939/1899/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-28_at_10.44.07_AM_medium.png?v=1514475872"><p>The option pair of carbon fiber shock towers not only look amazing, but also adds extra stiffness to the suspension for optimal performance. The carbon fiber material is extra-lightweight which lowers the center of gravity on the RS4 Sport 3 as well.</p></div>
                    <h2>OIL-FILLED THREADED SHOCKS</h2>
                    <p>The RS4 Sport 3 is fitted with a set composite coilover-style oil-filled shocks, just like what you'd see on a real race car. The fully adjustable shocks are fully tunable to provide the optimum chassis performance on a wide variety of road surfaces. The ride height is quickly adjustable by using the threaded shock collars. Further tuning adjustments are also possible by changing the springs and shock oil weight.</p>
